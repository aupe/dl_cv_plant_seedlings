# Plant Seedlings Classification
Can you differentiate a weed from a crop seedling?
The ability to do so effectively can mean better crop yields and better stewardship of the environment.
The Aarhus University Signal Processing group, in collaboration with University of Southern Denmark, has recently released a dataset containing images of approximately 960 unique plants belonging to 12 species at several growth stages.
Dataset is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification

Here you can find EDA of this data set and modeling using deep learning.
